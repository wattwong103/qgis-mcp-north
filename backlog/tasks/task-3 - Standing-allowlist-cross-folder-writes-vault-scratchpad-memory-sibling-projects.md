## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Always active via the tracked sentinel .worktrees/.active-task. Its permittedExternalPaths frontmatter is the only mechanism the ai-sdlc v0.20.1 Write/Edit hook offers for writes outside this repo. Keep status In Progress (backlog cleanup archives Done tasks; the hook only reads backlog/tasks/). Per-worktree sentinels written by the ai-sdlc execute pipeline take precedence, so pipeline tasks that write to the vault need these paths in their own frontmatter. PC owners: append the machine's Claude temp and ~/.claude/projects roots.
