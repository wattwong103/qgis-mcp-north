"""Live integration tests for HeadlessExecutor.

Skipped unless a working QGIS Python launcher is reachable. Set
``QGIS_MCP_WORKFLOWS_QGIS_LAUNCHER=...`` to override the auto-detection (default
on Windows is ``M:\\QGIS LTR\\bin\\python-qgis-ltr.bat``).

These tests spawn a real PyQGIS subprocess each, so they're slow (~5-10s of
``initQgis`` per test instance). Use ``-k headless`` to run only this file
during quick iteration.
